# Release 1.0 #

  * color theme for the OLPC XO, and perhaps more customizations. (depends on what Martin wants)
  * [issues targeted for the release.](http://code.google.com/p/paintweb/issues/list?q=milestone=Release1.0)

# Further down the road #

  * check the [open issues](http://code.google.com/p/paintweb/issues/list).
  * allow editing of multiple images in a single PaintWeb instance;
  * hybrid undo system, not like now (storing ImageDatas);
  * hybrid drawing: vectorial + bitmap drawing;
  * layers;
  * non-destructive filters;
  * color gradients and fill patterns;
  * macros: look into the possibility of implementing a scripting API compatible with that of Photoshop. Photoshop can run JavaScript. PaintWeb can run JavaScript: just provide the same API. Obviously, PaintWeb could implement only a subset, but it would be very good if this kind of work would be successful.

That should be all for now. Huh, lots of work to do.

Volunteers are needed! Please contact me if you want to help. Thank you! ;)
