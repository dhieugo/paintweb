PaintWeb is a Web application which allows users to draw inside the Web browser, making use of the new [HTML 5 Canvas API](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html).

Go ahead and [try the PaintWeb demos](http://www.robodesign.ro/paintweb/trunk/demos/) right now!
